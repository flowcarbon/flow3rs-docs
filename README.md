# Flow3rs Dev Docs

This repo contains the code for the flow3rs auction that is used offchain.

Keep us honest by running through the original code we are using to verify that the results are valid!

Don't forget to participate in [the auction](https://mint.flow3rs.io/).


## Setup

It's easy. These are the command line steps to get the notebooks up and running:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter-lab
```
